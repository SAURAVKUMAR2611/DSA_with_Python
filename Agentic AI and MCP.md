Google Drive Permission:
Here's how you can check and fix the Google Drive access permissions for Claude:

**Step 1: Check Connected Apps in Google Account**
1. Go to [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)
2. Click on **Security** from the left sidebar
3. Scroll down to **Third-party apps with account access**
4. Click **Manage third-party access**
5. Look for **Claude** or **Anthropic** in the list and click on it to see what permissions it has

**Step 2: What to Look For**
- If Claude only has **partial access**, it may only be able to read certain file types (like Google Docs) but not PDFs.
- If Claude has **full Drive access**, it should be able to see all file types including PDFs.

**Step 3: Fix It (if needed)**
- If the permissions seem limited, you can **remove** the current access and **reconnect** Google Drive to Claude with broader permissions.
- To reconnect, go to Claude's settings (in this interface), find the **Google Drive integration**, disconnect it, and reconnect it — making sure to grant full access when prompted.

**Step 4: Re-authorize in Claude**
1. In Claude, click on your profile or **settings**
2. Look for **Integrations** or **Connected Apps**
3. Disconnect Google Drive and reconnect it, granting all requested permissions this time

This should allow Claude to search and access PDFs stored in your Google Drive. Would you like help with anything else?

# Use of File System Connector:

Great that you have the File System connected! Here's what you can do with it:

**File Operations**
- Read, create, edit, and delete files on your computer
- Move or rename files and folders
- Search for specific files by name or pattern
- List directory contents and folder structures

**Practical Tasks You Can Try**

*Document & Content Work*
- "Summarize this text file for me" — Claude reads and summarizes local files
- "Fix grammar in my essay saved at Desktop/essay.txt"
- "Convert this CSV data into a formatted report"

*Code & Development*
- Read your code files and debug them
- Make edits directly to your source code files
- Scan a project folder and explain the codebase structure
- Create new code files based on your requirements

*File Organization*
- Find duplicate or misnamed files
- List all files of a certain type in a folder (e.g., all .pdf or .docx files)
- Reorganize folder structures by moving files around

*Data & Research*
- Read and analyze data from CSV or text files
- Extract specific information from large text files
- Merge or compare content from multiple files

*Automation Support*
- Create scripts or config files and save them directly
- Set up project templates by creating folder structures and starter files

**Your Accessible Directory**
Based on what I can see, your allowed directory is `C:\Users\Saura\OneDrive\Desktop` — so all the above tasks work within that path.

Would you like to try any of these out? Just tell me what you'd like to do!
